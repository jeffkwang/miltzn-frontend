Wherever you go, we want our pillows and cushions to be a touch of your heart â€” to remind you that, wherever you are, you are home. \nWe are working on a line of tufted pillow and cushion products that will add joy and comfort to your life. Tufting is the process of embedding yarn strands into cloth. We tuft our designs and have them professionally sewn and finished into pillows and cushions. All our products are handmade to order with nothing but quality, robust material. \nAt the moment, we are just man and machine, working out of our home office. We are working to expand our operations in order to give you a better product at even better prices."
